                        If you’ve ever built anything with web technologies, 
                        you’re probably familiar with MDN Web Docs. With about 13,000 pages documenting 
                        how to use programming languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, the site has 
                        about 8,000 people using it at any given moment. MDN relies on contributors to help maintain 
                        its ever-expanding and up to date documentation. We reached out to 4 long-time community 
                        contributors to talk about how and why they started contributing, why they kept going, 
                        and ask what advice they have for new contributors.The post Contributing to MDN: Meet

                    <p> 
                        In Firefox 95, we're shipping a novel sandboxing technology called RLBox 
                        — developed in collaboration with researchers at the University of California San Diego 
                        and the University of Texas — that makes it easy and efficient to isolate subcomponents 
                        to make the browser more secure. This technology opens up new opportunities 
                        beyond what's been possible with traditional process-based sandboxing, 
                        and we look forward to expanding its usage and (hopefully) seeing it adopted in other browsers
                        and software projects.The post WebAssembly and Back Again: Fine-Grained Sandboxing in Firefox 95
